                    <h1 id="EXPbitandMPLSQueuing-Overview"><span class="mw-headline">Overview</span></h1><p>When the MPLS label is attached to the packet, it increases packet length by 32 bits (4 bytes). These 32 bits are broken down as follows:</p><ul><li>label value itself (20 bits)</li><li>EXP (&quot;experimental&quot;) field (3 bits)</li><li>time to live field (8 bits)</li><li>bottom of stack field (1 bit)</li></ul><p>The use of &quot;experimental&quot; bits is not specified by MPLS standards, but the most common use is to carry QoS information, similar to 802.1q priority in the VLAN tag. Note that the EXP field is 3 bits only therefore it can carry values from 0 to 7 only, which allows having 8 traffic classes.</p><h1 id="EXPbitandMPLSQueuing-EXPfieldtreatmentinRouterOS"><span class="mw-headline">EXP field treatment in RouterOS</span></h1><p>When RouterOS receives an MPLS packet, it sets the &quot;ingress priority&quot; value for the packet to that carried inside the top label. Note that &quot;ingress priority&quot; <strong>is not</strong> a field inside packet headers - it can be thought of as an additional mark assigned to a packet while being processed by the router. When RouterOS labels an MPLS packet, it sets EXP bits to &quot;priority&quot; (not &quot;ingress priority&quot;!) assigned to the packet. When RouterOS switches MPLS packet, &quot;ingress priority&quot; is automatically copied to &quot;priority&quot;, this way regular MPLS switching communicates priority info over the whole label switched path.</p><p>Additional info on &quot;ingress priority&quot; and &quot;priority&quot; handling is also in <a href="WMM-and-VLAN-priority_113573898.html">WMM and VLAN priority</a>.</p><p>Therefore what happens to the EXP field depends based on what action is taken on the packet:</p><ul><li>if the packet is MPLS switched (by popping the label off the packet and pushing on the new one), the EXP field in the new label will be the same as in the received label, because:<ul><li>RouterOS sets &quot;ingress priority&quot; to EXP bits in the received label</li><li>Switching automatically sets &quot;priority&quot; to &quot;ingress priority&quot;</li><li>RouterOS labels the packet with a new label and sets its EXP bits to value in &quot;priority&quot;.</li></ul></li><li>if the packet is MPLS switched by using penultimate-hop-popping (the received label is popped off and no new one is pushed on), the EXP field of received priority stays in the &quot;priority&quot; field of the packet and may be used by some other MAC protocol, e.g. WMM or 802.1q VLAN, for example:<ul><li>RouterOS sets &quot;ingress priority&quot; to EXP bits in the received label</li><li>Switching automatically sets &quot;priority&quot; to &quot;ingress priority&quot;</li><li>RouterOS switches the packet to the next hop (without pushing on the label) and that happens over the VLAN interface</li><li>VLAN interface sets 802.1q priority in the VLAN header to the &quot;priority&quot; value of the packet.</li></ul></li></ul><p>Note that penultimate-hop-popping can therefore lose QoS information carried over label switched path at the last hop. In cases where this is not desirable, penultimate-hop-popping behavior should be disabled by using the Explicit NULL label instead of the Implicit NULL label for the last hop in the label switched path. Using an Explicit NULL label for the last hop is the default behavior for MPLS TE tunnels.</p><ul><li>if a packet is supposed to be sent over label switched path (the first label will get pushed on the packet), EXP bits will be set to value in &quot;priority&quot;, which in turn can be set up properly using firewall rules or other means (e.g. from DSCP field in IP header)</li><li>if a packet is received for local processing, &quot;ingress priority&quot; is set to the EXP field of the received packet and can therefore be used to update the DSCP field of the packet or set &quot;priority&quot; from &quot;ingress priority&quot; using firewall rules</li></ul><p><br/></p><h1 id="EXPbitandMPLSQueuing-MPLSMangleandQueuing">MPLS Mangle and Queuing</h1><p>RouterOS firewall works only with IP traffic, which means that it is not possible to mark MPLS packets directly in mangle and limit by queues. Queuing had to be done on ingress edge router before MPLS header is added or on egress edge router after MPLS label is removed. </p><p>Starting from ROS v7.17 MPLS Mangle is added. This allows to add packet mark based on exp bit, or change the assigned exp bit on label switching (P) routers or on PE output after MPLS encapsulation.</p><p>This configuration is accessible from <span style="color:var(--ds-icon-accent-teal,#2898bd);"><code>/mpls/mangle</code></span> menu. </p><h2 id="EXPbitandMPLSQueuing-BasicExample">Basic Example</h2><p>Lets look at very basic example where on the label switching router (P) along the LSP we want to mark packets with exp bit 0, limit the bandwidth and change exp bit to 3:</p><div class="code panel pdl" style="border-width: 1px;"><div class="codeContent panelContent pdl">
<pre class="syntaxhighlighter-pre" data-syntaxhighlighter-params="brush: routeros; gutter: false">/mpls mangle

/queue tree
add limit-at=10M max-limit=10M name=mpls_queue packet-mark=m0 parent=sfp-sfpplus2</pre>
</div></div><p><br/>Keep in mind that MPLS packets cannot be queued with queues that are using IMQ interfaces (simple queue, queue tree global), so we need to use queue tree with &quot;real&quot; interface as a parent.</p><p>MPLS Mangle table also shows matched packet count that is useful for setup debugging:</p><div class="code panel pdl" style="border-width: 1px;"><div class="codeContent panelContent pdl">

</div></div><p><br/></p><p>Another important thing is that MPLS mangle rules are not executed line by line like regular firewall mangle rules, MPLS Mangle is a set of actions that are applied in one go.<br/>For example, lets look at the set of rules</p><div class="code panel pdl" style="border-width: 1px;"><div class="codeContent panelContent pdl">

</div></div><p>In this example, if incoming packet has exp bit 0, third rule will have no effect.</p><p>And once the action is set for specific exp bit it cannot be modified by another rules:</p><div class="code panel pdl" style="border-width: 1px;"><div class="codeContent panelContent pdl">
