</div></p><h1 class="firstHeading" id="WirelessTroubleshooting-WirelessDebugLogs">Wireless Debug Logs</h1><p>Debugging wireless problems using Logs.</p><p>By default RouterOS wireless log shows that client connects and disconnects as simple entries:</p><div class="code panel pdl" style="border-width: 1px;"><div class="codeContent panelContent pdl">
<pre class="syntaxhighlighter-pre" data-syntaxhighlighter-params="brush: ros; gutter: false">22:32:18 wireless,info 00:80:48:41:AF:2A@wlan1: connected</pre>
</div></div><p>It is enough for regular users to know that the wireless client with MAC address &quot;00:80:48:41:AF:2A&quot; is connected to wireless interface &quot;wlan1&quot;. But actually there are more log entries available than are shown in standard logging. They are called 'debug' logs which give more detailed information. In the following Debug Log example you will see the same client connecting to the AP in more detail than found in typical logging:</p><div class="code panel pdl" style="border-width: 1px;"><div class="codeContent panelContent pdl">
<pre class="syntaxhighlighter-pre" data-syntaxhighlighter-params="brush: ros; gutter: false">22:33:20 wireless,debug wlan1: 00:80:48:41:AF:2A attempts to connect
22:33:20 wireless,debug wlan1: 00:80:48:41:AF:2A not in local ACL, by default accept
22:33:20 wireless,info 00:80:48:41:AF:2A@wlan1: connected</pre>
</div></div><p>Debug Logs will give you more specific information on each step of the Client wireless connection and disconnection. The first line shows that the wireless client tried to connect to the AP. On the second line the AP checked to see if that client is allowed to connect to the AP and the resulting action. And only on the third line do you see that the client is connected. This is merely one example of the debug log messages. The description of all debug entries is written below.</p><p>To enable the wireless debug logs you should execute such commands:</p><div class="code panel pdl" style="border-width: 1px;"><div class="codeContent panelContent pdl">

All connection related information must be deleted, because during association process connection parameters are negotiated (therefore &quot;disconnected&quot;).

Log messages include numeric code and textual description from appropriate standard in 802.11 standards group. Although these are intended to be as descriptive as possible, it must be taken into account that actual reason/status code that appears in management frames depends solely on equipment or software manufacturer - where one device sends 802.11 management frame including proper reason/status code for situation that caused the frame, other may send frame with &quot;unspecified&quot; reason/status code. Therefore reason/status code should only be considered informational.</p><p>As 802.11 standards evolve, RouterOS may miss textual descriptions for reason/status codes that some devices use. In such case numeric value should be used to lookup meaning in 802.11 standards.</p><p>In order to properly interpret reason/status code, good understanding of 802.11 group standards is necessary. Most of the textual descriptions are self-explaining. Explanation for some of most commonly seen reson/status codes follows.</p><p><strong>class 2 frame received (6)</strong> - device received &quot;class 2&quot; frame (association/reassociation management frame) before completing 802.11 authentication process;</p><p><strong>class 3 frame received (7)</strong> - device received &quot;class 3&quot; frame (data frame) before completing association process;</p><h1 class="firstHeading" id="WirelessTroubleshooting-WirelessFAQ">Wireless FAQ</h1><h2 id="WirelessTroubleshooting-Settings"><span class="mw-headline">Settings</span></h2><p><strong><span class="mw-headline">Why I can't connect to MikroTik 802.11n AP with Apple Mac devices?</span></strong></p><p>This problem is only seen on Mac devices based on Broadcom wireless chipsets. In order to connect with such wireless device to MikroTik 802.11n AP make sure that you don't use 'short' preamble-mode. Use 'long' or 'both' preamble-mode and Mac wireless devices will be able to connect.</p><p><strong><span class="mw-headline">By changing some wireless settings the wireless link works unstable</span></strong></p><p>Sometimes when you change some wireless setting for tuning the links you got so far that the link isn't establishing any more or works unstable and you don't remember what settings you had in the beginning. In this case, you can use the <em>reset-configuration</em> command in the wireless menu - it will reset the all the wireless settings for the specific wireless interface and you will be able to configure the interface from the start. Note that executing this command also disables the interface, so please be careful not to execute this command if you are configuring router remotely using that wireless link that you want to reset the configuration.</p><p><strong><span class="mw-headline">What are wireless retransmits and where to check them?</span></strong></p><p>Wireless retransmission occur when an interface sends out a frame and doesn't receive back an acknowledgment (ACK), causing it to try sending the frame again until an acknowledgment is received or the maximum allowed retransmission count for a packet is reached. Wireless retransmits increase the latency and lower the throughput of a wireless link. The number of retransmissions taking place can be determined by subtracting the value of the <strong>frames</strong> parameter from the value of the 'hw-frames<strong> parameter for a given entry in the registration table. Some number of retransmissions is to be expected, but if the value of </strong>frames<strong> exceeds the value of </strong>frames<strong> multiple times, there is an issue with the wireless link that requires troubleshooting.</strong></p><p><strong><span class="mw-headline">Can I compare frames with hw-frames also on Nstreme links?</span></strong></p><p>The <strong>frames</strong> counts only those which contain actual data. In the case of Nstreme, only the ACK can be transmitted in a single frame, if there is no other data to send. These ACK frames will not be added to the <strong>frames</strong> count, but they will appear at <strong>hw-frames</strong>. If there is traffic on both directions at maximum speed (eg. there will be no only-ack frames), then you can't compare <strong>frames</strong> to <strong>hw-frames</strong> as in case of regular wireless links.</p><p><strong><span class="mw-headline">What TX-power values can I use?</span></strong></p><p>The tx-power default setting is the maximum tx-power that the card can use and is taken from the cards eeprom. If you want to use larger tx-power values, you are able to set them, but <strong>do it at your own risk</strong>, as it will probably damage your card eventually! Usually, one should use this parameter only to reduce the tx-power.</p><p>In general, tx-power controlling properties should be left at the default settings. Changing the default setting may help with some cards in some situations, but without testing, the most common result is the degradation of range and throughput. Some of the problems that may occur are:</p><ul><li>overheating of the power amplifier chip and the card which will cause lower efficiency and more data errors;</li><li>overdriving the amplifier which will cause more data errors;</li><li>excessive power usage for the card and this may overload the 3.3V power supply of the board that the card is located on resulting in voltage drop and reboot or excessive temperatures for the board.</li></ul><p><strong><span class="mw-headline">What TX-power-mode is the best?</span></strong></p><p><em>TX-power-mode</em> tells the wireless card which tx-power values should be used. By default, this setting is set to <em>default</em>.</p><ul><li><strong>default</strong> means that the card will use the tx-power values from the cards eeprom and will ignore the setting what is specified by the user in the <em>tx-power</em> field.</li><li><strong>card-rates</strong> means that for different data rates the tx-power is calculated according to the cards transmit power algorithm from the cards eeprom and as an argument it takes <em>tx-power</em> value specified by the user.</li><li><strong>all-rates-fixed</strong> means that that the card will use one tx-power value for all data rates which is specified by the user in <em>tx-power</em> field.</li></ul><p>Note that it is not recommended to use 'all-rates-fixed' mode as the wireless card tx-power for the higher data rates is lower and by forcing to use the fixed tx-power rates also for the higher data rates might result in the same problems like in the previous question about tx-power setting. In the case of MikroTik Radio devices, the power will not be higher than the power written in the EEPROM. For most of the cases if you want to change the tx-power settings it is recommended to use the <em>tx-power-mode=card-rates</em> and it is recommended to lower and not to raise tx-power. In case of AR9300 and newer Atheros wireless chipsets &quot;tx-power-mode=all-rate-fixed&quot; is the only option as &quot;card-rates&quot; option isn't working on those chipsets.</p><p><strong><span class="mw-headline">What is CCQ and how are the values determined?</span></strong></p><p>Client Connection Quality (CCQ) is a value in percent that shows how effective the bandwidth is used regarding the theoretically maximum available bandwidth. CCQ is weighted average of values Tmin/Treal, that get calculated for every transmitted frame, where Tmin is time it would take to transmit given frame at highest rate with no retries and Treal is time it took to transmit frame in real life (taking into account necessary retries it took to transmit frame and transmit rate).</p><p><strong><span class="mw-headline">What is hw-retries setting?</span></strong></p><p>Number of times sending frame is retried without considering it a transmission failure. The data rate is decreased upon failure and frame is sent again. Three sequential failures on lowest supported rate suspend transmission to this destination for the duration of <em>on-fail-retry-time</em>. After that, the frame is sent again. The frame is being retransmitted until transmission success, or until the client is disconnected after <em>disconnect-timeout</em>. The frame can be discarded during this time if <em>frame-lifetime</em> is exceeded. In case of Nstreme &quot;on-fail-retry-time&quot;, &quot;disconnect-timeout&quot; and &quot;frame-lifetime&quot; settings are not used. So after three sequential failures on the lowest supported rate, the wireless link is disconnected with &quot;extensive data loss&quot; message.</p><p><strong><span class="mw-headline">What is disconnect-timeout setting?</span></strong></p><p>This interval is measured from the third sending failure on the lowest data rate. At this point 3 * (<em>hw-retries</em> + 1) frame transmits on the lowest data rate had failed. During <em>disconnect-timeout</em> packet transmission will be retried with <em>on-fail-retry-time</em> interval. If no frame can be transmitted successfully during <em>disconnect-timeout</em>, the connection is closed, and this event is logged as &quot;extensive data loss&quot;. Successful frame transmission resets this timer.</p><p><strong><span class="mw-headline">What is adaptive-noise-immunity setting?</span></strong></p><p>Adaptive Noise Immunity (ANI) adjusts various receiver parameters dynamically to minimize interference and noise effect on the signal quality. This setting is added in the wireless driver for Atheros AR5212 and newer chipset cards</p><p><strong><span class="mw-headline">How does wireless device measure signal strength, when access-list or connect-list are used ?</span></strong></p><p>The reported signal level is exponentially weighted moving average with a smoothing factor of 50%.</p><p><strong><span class="mw-headline">What error correction methods are supported in the RouterOS wireless?</span></strong></p><p>ARQ method is supported in nstreme protocols. Regular 802.11 standard does not include ARQ - retransmission of corrupt frames is based on acknowledgment protocol. RouterOS supports forward error correction coding (convolutional coding) with coding rates: 1/2, 2/3, or 3/4.</p><p><strong><span class="mw-headline">Configuring RouterOS device for 160MHz use</span></strong></p><p>If the RouterOS device supports 4x4 transmission, additionally to setting 160MHz channel width, make sure to set &quot;rate-set=default&quot; on the wireless interface so all streams are available</p><p>If the client does not support Extended NSS and can only perform 2x2 transmission, set &quot;vht-supported-mcs=mcs0-9,mcs0-9,none&quot;</p><h2 id="WirelessTroubleshooting-Setups"><span class="mw-headline">Setups</span></h2><p><strong><span class="mw-headline">Will an amplifier improve the speed on my link?</span></strong></p><p>It depends on your signal quality and noise. Remember that you can probably get a better link with low output power setting, and a good antenna. An amplifier increases the noise and will only cause problems with the link.</p><p>The amplifier gets a boost on both the transmitted <strong>and</strong> received signal. Thus, in &quot;silent&quot; areas, where you are alone or with very few &quot;noise&quot; or &quot;competition&quot;, you might get excellent results. On the other side, in crowded areas, with lots of wireless activity, you will also increase signal received from every other competitor or noise source, which may dramatically lower the overall quality of the link. Also, take in account the EIRP to see if your link remains in legal limits.</p><p>You could also get a better signal on &quot;11b only&quot; radios, which see most of 802.11g as &quot;noise&quot;, thus filtering better the usable signal.</p><p><strong><span class="mw-headline">How to fine-tune the wireless link with hw-retries?</span></strong></p><p>You should understand that for 802.11 devices there is a really limited amount of information (or &quot;feedback&quot; from the environment) that devices can use to tune their behavior:</p><ul><li>signal strength, which could be used to figure out best transmit rate knowing receiver sensitivity. Sill this is not reliable taking into account that sensitivity for different receivers varies (e.g. changes over time), path conditions are not symmetric (and device can only measure signal strength it receives), etc.</li><li>by receiving/not receiving acknowledgment for frame sent.</li></ul><p>Taking into account that using signal strength is not reliable, 802.11 devices are essentially left with only one &quot;feedback&quot; to tune its operation - success/failure of transmission. When transmission fails (ACK not received in time), there is no way how sender can figure out why it failed - either because of noise, multipath, direct interference (and whether that disturbed actual data frame or the ACK itself) - frame just did not make it and in general it does not matter &quot;why&quot;. All that matters is the packet error rate.</p><p>Therefore RouterOS implements an algorithm to try to use medium most efficiently in any environment by using only this limited information, giving users the ability to control how the algorithm works and describing the algorithm. And there are only a few usage guidelines, not a set of values you should use in a particular situation.</p><p>In general - the larger <em>hw-retries</em>, the better &quot;feedback&quot; device gets about medium ability to deliver frame at particular rate (e.g. if sending frame with rate 54mbps fails 16 times, it is telling you more than if it fails with 2 retries) and the better it can figure out optimal transmit rate, at the expense of latency it can introduce in network - because during all those failing retries, other devices in this channel cannot send. So <strong>bigger</strong> <em>hw-retries</em> can be suggested for ptp backbone links - where it is known that link must be always on. <strong>Less</strong> <em>hw-retries</em> make rate selection adapt faster at the expense of some accuracy (going below 2 is not reasonable in most cases), this can be suggested for ptmp links, where it is normal for links to connect/disconnect and keeping latency down is important.</p><p><em>on-fail-retry-time</em> and <em>disconnect-timeout</em> controls how hard device will try to consider remote party &quot;connected&quot;. Larger <em>disconnect-timeout</em> will make the device not &quot;disconnect&quot; other party, even if there are lots of loss at the smallest possible transmission rate. This again is most useful for &quot;weak&quot; links that are known that they &quot;must&quot; be established (e.g. backbone links). In ptmp networks large <em>disconnect-timeout</em> will again increase latency in the network during the time e.g. AP will attempt to send data to some client that has just been disabled (AP will try to do this for the whole <em>disconnect-timeout</em>).</p><p><em>frame-lifetime</em> allows to tune for how long AP is attempting to use frame for transmitting before considering that it is not worth delivering it (for example, if sending frame fails at lowest possible rate, <em>on-fail-retry-time</em> timer is enabled, if during this timer <em>frame-lifetime</em> expires, particular frame is dropped and the next transmission attempt will happen with the next frame. Disabled <em>frame-lifetime</em> means that wireless will ensure in order delivery of &quot;all&quot; data frames, no matter how long it takes, &quot;or&quot; will drop the connection if everything fails). This allows optimizing for different types of traffic e.g. for real-time traffic - if the primary use of the wireless network is e.g. voip, then it can be reasonable to limit <em>frame-lifetime</em>, because voip tolerates small loss better than high latency.</p><p><strong><span class="mw-headline">Is it possible to use the wireless repeater only with one radio interface?</span></strong></p><p>This setup it possible by using WDS on the wireless interface which is running in ap-bridge mode. And in newer RouterOS versions it is possible to configure wireless repeater mode.</p><p><strong><span class="mw-headline">Nv2 wireless link disconnects very often</span></strong></p><p>When Nv2 wireless link experiences disconnections and in log section most of the messages are 'control frame timeout', you can try to lower the transmit output power of the wireless cards if the signal of the link is strong. We suggest using tx-power-mode=card-rates for lowering the tx-power of the wireless card. If the problem continues to try to use a different wireless frequency that might have less interference. If that also didn't help, please contact <a class="external-link" href="mailto:support@mikrotik.com" rel="nofollow">support@mikrotik.com</a> with a support output file from the affected AP and the Station which are made after those disconnections. </p>
