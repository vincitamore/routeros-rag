On the other hand, if you're experiencing issues with TCP performance and suspect that ACK filtering might be contributing, you could try disabling it or using the less aggressive option.</span></li></ol><h1 id="CAKE-Wash"><span style="color:var(--ds-text-accent-teal-bolder,#164555);">Wash</span></h1><p><span style="color:var(--ds-text-accent-teal-bolder,#164555);">The &quot;wash&quot; option in the CAKE queue discipline is used to address the issue of frequently mis-marked traffic entering or exiting a DiffServ (Differentiated Services) domain. When traffic passes through networks or providers, there is a chance that the DSCP (Differentiated Services Code Point) markings could be modified or incorrectly assigned.</span></p><p><span style="color:var(--ds-text-accent-teal-bolder,#164555);">To illustrate this with a real-life example and analogy:</span></p><p><span style="color:var(--ds-text-accent-teal-bolder,#164555);">Let's imagine you are running a busy airport. Different airlines have assigned different priority levels to their passengers based on their ticket classes (economy, business, first-class). These priority levels are analogous to the DSCP markings in a network.</span></p><p><span style="color:var(--ds-text-accent-teal-bolder,#164555);">However, as passengers move through various transit airports, there is a possibility that the assigned priority levels could be changed or mis-marked due to different airline policies or inconsistencies at the transit airports. This is similar to the mis-marking of traffic in transit networks.</span></p><p><span style="color:var(--ds-text-accent-teal-bolder,#164555);">Now, in the context of the airport, let's assume that upon arrival at your airport, passengers are divided into separate queues based on their priority levels. This division ensures that passengers in higher-priority classes are processed more quickly and receive better service.</span></p><p><span style="color:var(--ds-text-accent-teal-bolder,#164555);">However, because the priority levels assigned at previous airports may not be reliable, it becomes necessary to &quot;wash&quot; or clear the assigned priority levels before the passengers enter the queues at your airport. This is similar to the &quot;wash&quot; option in CAKE, which clears extra DSCP markings after priority queuing has taken place.</span></p><p><span style="color:var(--ds-text-accent-teal-bolder,#164555);">In situations where inbound traffic's DSCP markings cannot be trusted (similar to cases like Comcast Cable), it is recommended to use a single queue &quot;besteffort&quot; mode with the &quot;wash&quot; option. This means that all incoming traffic is treated as the default &quot;best effort&quot; class, and any potentially unreliable or mis-marked DSCP values are cleared before further processing.</span></p><p><span style="color:var(--ds-text-accent-teal-bolder,#164555);">In our airport analogy, using a single queue &quot;besteffort&quot; mode with &quot;wash&quot; would mean that regardless of the priority assigned at previous airports, all passengers are initially treated as standard passengers (best effort class) until their priority can be accurately determined and assigned at your airport.</span></p><p><span style="color:var(--ds-text-accent-teal-bolder,#164555);">This approach ensures that even if the DSCP markings of incoming traffic have been mis-marked or modified during transit, the traffic is treated fairly and uniformly within your network, without relying on potentially unreliable markings from external sources.</span></p><p><span style="color:var(--ds-text-accent-teal-bolder,#164555);">By applying the &quot;wash&quot; option in CAKE, network administrators can mitigate the impact of mis-marked or modified DSCP markings, providing a more consistent and reliable Quality of Service (QoS) treatment within their network domain.</span></p><h1 id="CAKE-DiffservRFC2474andRFC2475"><span style="color:var(--ds-text-accent-teal-bolder,#164555);">Diffserv RFC2474 and RFC2475</span></h1><p><span style="color:var(--ds-text-accent-teal-bolder,#164555);">Diffserv (Differentiated Services) is a mechanism used to prioritize and classify network traffic based on the Diffserv field in the IP packet header. CAKE (Common Applications Kept Enhanced) provides Diffserv support, allowing traffic to be divided into &quot;tins&quot; (traffic classes) and applying different treatment to each tin. Here's a breakdown of the Diffserv presets in CAKE along with real-world examples:</span></p><p><span style="color:var(--ds-text-accent-teal-bolder,#164555);"><strong>besteffort </strong>-The &quot;besteffort&quot; preset in CAKE disables priority queuing and places all traffic into a single tin. This means that all traffic is treated equally without any specific prioritization.<span> </span><em>This preset can be suitable for non-critical or low-priority traffic, such as general web browsing or background file downloads, where equal treatment is sufficient.</em></span></p><p><span style="color:var(--ds-text-accent-teal-bolder,#164555);"><strong>precedence </strong>- The &quot;precedence&quot; preset enables the legacy interpretation of the TOS (Type of Service) &quot;Precedence&quot; field. However, its usage on the modern internet is discouraged, as it is an outdated mechanism.<span> </span><em>In the past, this field was used to indicate different levels of priority, such as high, medium, or low, but it is no longer widely used or recommended.</em></span></p><p><span style="color:var(--ds-text-accent-teal-bolder,#164555);"><strong>diffserv4 </strong>- The &quot;diffserv4&quot; preset provides a general-purpose Diffserv implementation with four tins:</span> </p><ol><li><span style="color:var(--ds-text-accent-teal-bolder,#164555);"><strong>Bulk</strong>: This tin corresponds to CS1 (Class Selector 1) or LE (Low Extra), and it has a threshold of 6.25%. Traffic in this tin typically has a low priority.</span></li><li><span style="color:var(--ds-text-accent-teal-bolder,#164555);"><strong>Best Effort</strong>: This tin is for general traffic that doesn't fall into any specific Diffserv class. It has a threshold of 100%, meaning it receives all remaining bandwidth.</span></li><li><span style="color:var(--ds-text-accent-teal-bolder,#164555);"><strong>Video</strong>: This tin encompasses AF4x, AF3x, CS3, AF2x, CS2, TOS4, and TOS1. It has a threshold of 50%, providing a moderate priority for video traffic.</span></li><li><span style="color:var(--ds-text-accent-teal-bolder,#164555);"><strong>Voice</strong>: This tin covers CS7, CS6, EF (Expedited Forwarding), VA (Voice Admit), CS5, and CS4. It has a threshold of 25%, giving high priority to voice traffic.</span></li></ol><p><span style="color:var(--ds-text-accent-teal-bolder,#164555);"><em>In a network where video streaming, voice over IP (VoIP), and general internet traffic coexist, this preset can ensure that video and voice traffic receive appropriate priority, while bulk and best-effort traffic are handled accordingly.</em></span></p><p><span style="color:var(--ds-text-accent-teal-bolder,#164555);"><strong>diffserv3 </strong>(default) - The &quot;diffserv3&quot; preset is the default Diffserv implementation in CAKE, providing three tins:</span></p><ol><li><span style="color:var(--ds-text-accent-teal-bolder,#164555);"><strong>Bulk</strong>: Similar to the &quot;diffserv4&quot; preset, this tin represents CS1 or LE with a 6.25% threshold, serving as a low-priority traffic class.</span></li><li><span style="color:var(--ds-text-accent-teal-bolder,#164555);"><strong>Best Effort:</strong> This tin is for general traffic and has a threshold of 100%, treating all remaining traffic equally.</span></li><li><span style="color:var(--ds-text-accent-teal-bolder,#164555);"><strong>Voice</strong>: This tin covers CS7, CS6, EF, VA, and TOS4. It has a threshold of 25% and applies a reduced CoDel (Controlled Delay) interval, giving high priority to voice traffic.</span></li></ol><p><span style="color:var(--ds-text-accent-teal-bolder,#164555);"><em>In a network where voice traffic requires high priority, such as a VoIP system, while other traffic falls into a general category, the &quot;diffserv3&quot; preset can ensure appropriate priority for voice packets while maintaining fairness for other traffic.</em></span></p><p><span style="color:var(--ds-text-accent-teal-bolder,#164555);"><strong>diffserv8 </strong>- is an more advances purpuse diffserver with 8 tins:</span></p><p>The 8 classes in DiffServ8 are mapped to different types of network traffic based on their importance, using decimal values for Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP):</p><ol><li><strong>Network Control</strong> (48-63): Highest priority, often used for critical network traffic like routing information.</li><li><strong>Telephony</strong> (46): Traffic sensitive to latency, such as VoIP.</li><li><strong>Signaling</strong> (32-47): Control signals for real-time applications.</li><li><strong>Multimedia Conferencing</strong> (24-31): Video conferencing traffic.</li><li><strong>Real-time Interactive</strong> (40): Interactive applications, such as gaming.</li><li><strong>Multimedia Streaming</strong> (16-23): Streaming video and audio.</li><li><strong>Low Latency Data</strong> (8-15): Traffic requiring low latency, like financial transactions.</li><li><strong>Best Effort</strong> (0): Default traffic class with no special priority.</li></ol><h1 id="CAKE-&quot;unlimited&quot;or&quot;autorate-ingress&quot;"><span style="color:var(--ds-text-accent-teal-bolder,#164555);">&quot;unlimited&quot; or &quot;autorate-ingress&quot;</span></h1><p>When using the &quot;unlimited&quot; or &quot;autorate-ingress&quot; option in the CAKE queue discipline, CAKE automatically determines the download speed based on observed packet arrival times. Here's how it works:</p><ol><li><p>Monitoring Packet Arrival Times: CAKE continuously monitors the arrival times of incoming packets. It keeps track of the time intervals between consecutive packets to estimate the rate at which packets are being received.</p></li><li><p>Calculating Average Packet Arrival Rate: CAKE calculates the average packet arrival rate based on the observed arrival times. By dividing the number of received packets by the total time elapsed, it determines the average rate at which packets are arriving.</p></li><li><p>Deriving Download Speed: From the average packet arrival rate, CAKE infers the download speed or throughput of the network connection. It assumes that the packet arrival rate corresponds to the download speed, given that each packet represents a certain amount of data.</p></li><li><p>Dynamic Adjustment: As CAKE continues to monitor packet arrival times, it adjusts the download speed estimation dynamically. If the arrival rate increases, CAKE will update the download speed estimate to reflect the higher throughput. Conversely, if the arrival rate decreases, CAKE will adjust the estimate accordingly.</p></li></ol><p>By automatically determining the download speed, CAKE adapts to changes in the network conditions and ensures that traffic shaping and queuing algorithms are adjusted to optimize the utilization of available bandwidth.</p><p>It's worth noting that while CAKE can estimate the download speed based on packet arrival times, it does not have direct knowledge of the link capacity or the true download speed as reported by the network equipment or service provider. Instead, it relies on observed packet arrival rates to approximate the download speed for traffic shaping purposes.</p>
