RouterOS Network Portal - What I Actually Built
=================================================

A next-generation network management platform for RouterOS (MikroTik) devices that goes far beyond traditional single-device tools. Built as a centralized web portal with enterprise-grade monitoring, historical analytics, multi-user management, and advanced automation - accessible from anywhere without software installation.

REAL FUNCTIONALITY
------------------
**Device Management Dashboard**
â€¢ Main page with device grid showing live status, CPU, memory, uptime
â€¢ Device discovery with automatic connection testing
â€¢ One-click HTTPS security hardening (SSH keys + cert setup)
â€¢ Direct navigation to device configuration and monitoring

**Per-Device Configuration Pages** (/configuration/[deviceId])
â€¢ Overview: Device info, connection status, board details
â€¢ IP Addresses: Complete CRUD for interface IP assignments
â€¢ Routing: Static route management with gateway configuration  
â€¢ Firewall: Filter rules, NAT rules, address lists with advanced search
â€¢ IPsec VPN: Full VPN setup - policies, peers, profiles, active connections
â€¢ Terminal Manager: Persistent SSH sessions with history
â€¢ Backup & Restore: .backup file creation/download/restore via FTP

**Live Monitoring Dashboard** (/monitoring)
â€¢ System metrics charts: CPU, memory, storage, temperature over time
â€¢ Interface monitoring: Traffic graphs, error rates, packet counts
â€¢ Connection tracking table: Live network sessions with protocol details
â€¢ WebSocket-powered real-time updates (every 30 seconds)

**Enterprise User Management** (/admin/users)
â€¢ Complete user CRUD with search, filtering, bulk operations
â€¢ Role system: admin, operator, user, viewer with granular permissions
â€¢ Session management: View active sessions, force logouts
â€¢ Password reset, account status control, audit logging

**Database Administration** (/admin/disk-management, /admin/database)
â€¢ Disk usage analytics with table-by-table breakdown
â€¢ Data retention policies for system metrics, logs, backups
â€¢ Database viewer: Browse all tables, edit records, run SQL queries
â€¢ Storage cleanup and optimization tools

**Terminal System** (Unified across all pages)
â€¢ Persistent SSH sessions that survive page navigation
â€¢ Session history with searchable command logs
â€¢ Multi-device terminal switching in single interface
â€¢ Export terminal sessions to JSON

TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE
----------------------
**Frontend**: Next.js 15, TypeScript, glassmorphism CSS, Recharts visualizations
**Backend**: Fastify server, SQLite database, WebSocket real-time communication  
**RouterOS Integration**: REST API client + SSH proxy for advanced operations
**Security**: JWT authentication, role-based access, AES-256 encrypted SSH keys

CONFIGURATION CAPABILITIES
--------------------------
**Network Configuration**:
â€¢ IP address assignments per interface
â€¢ Static routing with distance and gateway settings
â€¢ Firewall filter rules (input/forward/output chains)
â€¢ NAT rules (srcnat/dstnat with masquerade)
â€¢ Address lists for firewall grouping

**VPN & Security**:
â€¢ IPsec policy configuration (encryption, authentication)
â€¢ IPsec peer setup (remote endpoints, secrets)
â€¢ IPsec profiles (DH groups, encryption algorithms)
â€¢ Active VPN connection monitoring

**System Operations**:
â€¢ Configuration backup creation and restoration
â€¢ SSH key generation and deployment
â€¢ HTTPS certificate setup and service hardening
â€¢ Direct SSH command execution

WHAT MAKES IT PROFESSIONAL
---------------------------
â€¢ **Real File Operations**: Downloads actual RouterOS .backup files via FTP
â€¢ **Security Hardening**: Automated HTTPS setup, SSH key auth, service lockdown
â€¢ **Session Persistence**: Terminal sessions survive browser refreshes and navigation
â€¢ **Enterprise UX**: Professional glassmorphism design, responsive layout
â€¢ **Connection Tracking**: Full RouterOS connection table with all protocol details

CURRENT STATUS
